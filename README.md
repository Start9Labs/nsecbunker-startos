## Cloning

Clone the noStrudel package repository locally.

git clone https://github.com/hzrd149/nostrudel-startos.git
cd nostrudel-startos
```

## Building

```
make
```

To build the `nostrudel` package for a single platform using start-sdk, run:

```
# for amd64
make x86
```
or
```
# for arm64
make arm
```

## Installing (on StartOS)

Run the following commands to determine successful install:
> :information_source: Change server-name.local to your Start9 server address

```
start-cli auth login

If you already have your `start-cli` config file setup with a default `host`, you can install simply by running:
